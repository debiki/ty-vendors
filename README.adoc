The packages were installed like so, from inside the container:

```
opm install fffonion/lua-resty-acme
```
    
Thereafter I copied the installed files to outside the Docker container (via a
read-write mounted host directory), and placed here in
`./usr-local-openresty-site/`, so now we can just Dockerfile COPY to install
lua-resty-acme, when building the Docker image. No need to run 'opm' and fetch
external things from GitHub; can build offline.

Apparently this approach is fine â€” opm installs only pure Lua packages. From
the docs:

> opm currently only supports pure Lua libraries but we will add support for
> Lua libraries in pure C or with some C components very soon

https://opm.openresty.org/docs#description

Meaning, opm downloads just Lua code; it won't compile any C code, or do any
build steps as part of the installation.  So, should be fine to just copy the
Lua files in the same way as opm itself would have done.

(In Nodejs, though, some packages start compiling C code via node-gyp when they get installed.)


And Wangchong @fffonion the lua-resty-acme project author agrees:

> Correct, opm only download lua files
